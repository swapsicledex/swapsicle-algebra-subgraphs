- Update FACTORY_ADDRESS in Algebra/src/utils/constants.ts
- Update USDC_WMatic_03_POOL, WHITELIST_TOKENS and STABLE_COINS in Algebra/src/utils/pricing.ts, through which the price in usd will be calculated.
- Depending on the order of the tokens in the pool, you must set the requred price( token0Price/token1Price) in Algebra/src/utils/pricing.ts#L41
